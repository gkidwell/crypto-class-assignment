crypto-class-assignment
=======================

Demonstration of simple ciphers using Java.


This was an assignment for a graduate-level Cryptology math class at Bridgewater State University taken during my undergraduate stay.

When run, it prompts the user to choose a simple cipher, and enter some text and possibly some options, and it will encrypt the text by manipulating the string accordingly.

It was meant to be a simple demonstration of some of the ciphers we had been taught in the class.
